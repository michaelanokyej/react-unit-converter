# React Unit Converter

## Problem

> they want to assign students unit-conversion problems on paper
> worksheets. After students turn in their completed worksheet, 
> the teachers want to be able to enter the questions and student 
> responses into a computer to be graded. Students will convert: 
> temperatures between Kelvin, Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Rakine.
> volumes between liters, tablespoons, cubic-inches, cups, cubic-feet,
> and gallons.
